Only open to upperclassmen and January Scholars , the North Side consists of Millbrook Apartments , The Village , Village East on-campus apartments , and all fraternity houses except the Zeta Beta Tau house , which is off campus and located just northwest of the South 40 . Sororities at Washington University do not have houses by their own accord . The Village is a group of residences where students who have similar interests or academic goals apply as small groups of 4 to 24 , known as BLOCs , to live together in clustered suites along with non-BLOCs . Like the South 40 , the residences around the Village also surround a recreational lawn .
Washington University spent its first half century in downtown St. Louis bounded by Washington Ave. , Lucas Place , and Locust Street . By the 1890s , owing to the dramatic expansion of the Manual School and a new benefactor in Robert Brookings , the University began to move west . The University Board of Directors began a process to find suitable ground and hired the landscape architecture firm Olmsted , Olmsted & Eliot of Boston . A committee of Robert S. Brookings , Henry Ware Eliot , and William Huse found a site of 103 acres -LRB- 41.7 ha -RRB- just beyond Forest Park , located west of the city limits in St. Louis County . The elevation of the land was thought to resemble the Acropolis and inspired the nickname of `` Hilltop '' campus , renamed the Danforth campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor William H. Danforth .
During fiscal year 2007 , $ 537.5 million was received in total research support , including $ 444 million in federal obligations .

Although chartered as a university , for many years Washington University functioned primarily as a night school located on 17th Street and Washington Avenue in the heart of downtown St. Louis . Owing to limited financial resources , Washington University initially used public buildings . Classes began on October 22 , 1854 , at the Benton School building . At first the university paid for the evening classes , but as their popularity grew , their funding was transferred to the St. Louis Public Schools . Eventually the board secured funds for the construction of Academic Hall and a half dozen other buildings . Later the university divided into three departments : the Manual Training School , Smith Academy , and the Mary Institute .
During the latter half of the 20th century , Washington University transitioned from a strong regional university to a national research institution . In 1957 , planning began for the construction of the `` South 40 , '' a complex of modern residential halls . With the additional on-campus housing , Washington University , which had been predominantly a `` streetcar college '' of commuter students , began to attract a more national pool of applicants . By 1964 , over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the St. Louis area .
The Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum , established in 1881 , is one of the oldest teaching museums in the country .

The university 's first chancellor was Joseph Gibson Hoyt . Crow secured the university charter from the Missouri General Assembly in 1853 , and Eliot was named President of the Board of Trustees . Early on , Eliot solicited support from members of the local business community , including John O'Fallon , but Eliot failed to secure a permanent endowment . Washington University is unusual among major American universities in not having had a prior financial endowment . The institution had no backing of a religious organization , single wealthy patron , or earmarked government support .
In 1899 , the university opened a national design contest for the new campus . The renowned Philadelphia firm Cope & Stewardson won unanimously with its plan for a row of Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by Oxford and Cambridge Universities . The cornerstone of the first building , Busch Hall , was laid on October 20 , 1900 . The construction of Brookings Hall , Ridgley , and Cupples began shortly thereafter . The school delayed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World 's Fair and Olympics . The delay allowed the university to construct ten buildings instead of the seven originally planned . This original cluster of buildings set a precedent for the development of the Danforth Campus ; Cope & Stewardson 's original plan and its choice of building materials have , with few exceptions , guided the construction and expansion of the Danforth Campus to the present day .
In 1867 , the university opened the first private nonsectarian law school west of the Mississippi River . By 1882 , Washington University had expanded to numerous departments , which were housed in various buildings across St. Louis .
